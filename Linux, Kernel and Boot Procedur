1.Linux
Linux is an operating system that is widely used across different types of devices like servers and computers
It’s actually based on Unix and is open-source, which means anyone can look at its code, use it for free, and even modify it if they want
Linux is very stable and secure, which is why companies prefer using it for their servers.
there are many distribution of Linux, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian etc


2.Kernel
The kernel is basically the heart of the Linux operating system. It's a program that runs in the background and manages the communication between the hardware and the software.
Some main jobs of the kernel include:
i)  Controlling how memory is used
ii) Managing processes that are running
iii)Handling input and output from devices


3. Boot Procedure 
When you turn on a computer that runs Linux, a lot of things happen before you see the login screen. This is known as the boot process.

Various Steps for the boot procedure are
BIOS : This is the first thing that runs. It checks the hardware and then looks for something to boot from, like a hard disk or USB.
Bootloader : The bootloader is a small program that loads the Linux kernel.
Kernel: Once the kernel is loaded, it takes over and starts setting things up – like memory, CPU, and devices. Then it looks for the root filesystem.
